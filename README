A simple pooling webserver
==========================

Features:
---------
 * Pooling using java.util.concurrent.Executor
 * Static file serving
 * Http Keep-alive handling

Architecture:
-------------

The main thread waits and accepts connections and then schedules processing of
the connection with the executor. If keep-alive is enabled the thread keeps waiting
for requests for a certain time.

Classes:
--------

SimplePooledWebServer - The main class accepting connections and scheduling processing of requests
Settings - Global configuration
Handler - An abstraction of a component handling incoming requests in their own thread.
HttpHandler - An abstract handler doing basic Http Request/Response handling
StaticHttpFileHandler - A HttpHandler serving static files from the file-system
PingHandler - An example handler echoing requests directly back to the client

Notes:
------

This is a proof of concept of a pooling web server. The real work is finding out the best settings
for pooling and timeouts.
